# Feature-Engineering-Model-Tuning
This project identifies the relevant signals for the manufacturing of a semiconductor. A semiconductor manufacturing process is under constant surveillance via the monitoring of signals.
However, all signals are not beneficial for the monitoring system. Hence I built a classifier to identify the relevant signals collected from the sensors required for the monitoring system. This project mainly
focuses on training a model with an XGboost classifier and tuning the model with different hyperparameter tuning techniques
